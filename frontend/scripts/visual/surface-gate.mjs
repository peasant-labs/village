/* non-empty-surface gate — the parity oracle's content assertion (vendored).

   A SELF-CONTAINED copy of the fairtrade design-system's `scripts/surface-gate.mjs`, vendored here so
   this app's capture harness has no cross-repo path dependency. Keep it byte-faithful to the upstream
   gate (same thresholds, same logic) so the demo side and this app side enforce the IDENTICAL content
   floor; if the upstream gate's thresholds move, re-vendor this copy.

   Imported by `village-shoot.mjs` (the production capture path) and callable from a self-check. There
   is no test-only variant — the same code that writes the captures asserts them.

   A blank / near-empty capture has a perfectly valid bounding box but paints only the background
   colour, so a box-size check cannot catch it — that is the silent-blank hole this gate closes. The
   gate decodes the PNG (in a headless page canvas, so there is no extra dependency) and FAILS unless
   the capture carries real content:
     - byte size      >= a per-surface floor (a full-size background-only PNG is ~5.9KB);
     - non-background  >= a minimum share of pixels differ from the dominant (background) colour;
     - distinct colour >= a minimum (a flat fill resolves to a single colour);
     - uniqueness      : no two DISTINCT surfaces may be byte-identical (a blank-capture bug produced
                         seven identical 5,891-byte blanks across totally different surfaces).

   Thresholds are calibrated against measured populations (both themes):
     blank capture : nonbg 0.00%, 1 distinct colour, ~5.9KB full-size
     real content  : nonbg 2.46%..23.2%, 9..161 colours, 35KB..176KB full / 491..645B scrubber
   each bound sits strictly between the two populations, so the gate fails every blank and passes
   every real surface. */
